# Robotic_Inguinal_Hernia
Robotic Inguinal Hernia Model in Florida

This analysis is focused on the outpatient Inguianl Hernia Repairs performed in the state of Florida. In this analysis we tried to demontrate that hospitals which are early adopters of robotic technology see a significant increase in their surgical volume. 
Open, laproscopic and robotic procedures were captures for the year 2010-2018 using ICD9, ICD10 and CPT codes.  
The main methodology used to perform this analysis is differnce in difference technique, and all analysis was performed in STATA and R. 

This analysis was performed by using Florida Agency for HealthCare Administration (FL AHCA) dataset for the Year 2010-2018. FL AHCA was primarily used to capture the procedures of interest and analyze the effect of robotic technology on surgical volume. 
Access to FL AHCA is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization by the Florida Agency of Health Care Administration, all of the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes.

We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identiies. All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Code for all steps involved in cleaning, linking, pre processing, propensity matching and modeling has been shared.
